# Personal Loan Application : LoanEase

A **Personal Loan Application** that enables users to instantly apply for personal loans from prestigious loan-providing banks. The app provides real-time interest rate information based on the user's **CIBIL score** and **monthly income**, ensuring that users get personalized loan offers.

## Features

- **Loan Application**: Users can apply for personal loans directly through the app.
- **CIBIL Score Integration**: Based on the user-provided CIBIL score, the app calculates the **interest rate** for the loan.
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: The app fetches real-time interest rates from partnered banks. These rates vary based on **CIBIL score** and **monthly income**.
- **Prestigious Loan Banks**: Partnered with top-tier banks for offering personal loans to users.
- **Loan Calculators**: Provides loan eligibility and repayment schedule based on different interest rates and amounts.
- **Secure Data Handling**: User data like CIBIL score, monthly income, and loan details are securely processed and stored.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: (soon)
  - VueJS
  - Bootstrap
- **Backend**:
  - Spring Boot (Java)
  - RESTful API design
  - JWT Authentication for secure access
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL
- **External Integrations**:
  - Real-time CIBIL score check (integration with external service)
  - Loan interest rates API (integration with partnered banks)
- **Authentication**:
  - JWT Token-based Authentication
- **Deployment**: (soon)
  - Docker
  - AWS EC2 / Heroku for hosting

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users first register and log in to the platform.
2. **CIBIL and Income Input**: After logging in, users input their **CIBIL score** and **monthly income**.
3. **Interest Rate Calculation**: Based on the **CIBIL score** and **monthly income**, the system fetches the dynamic interest rate from partnered banks.
4. **Loan Eligibility**: The app calculates whether the user is eligible for a loan based on their inputs. The eligibility criteria vary depending on the banksâ€™ policies.
5. **Loan Application**: If eligible, users can apply for a personal loan, select the loan amount, and check the repayment schedule.
6. **Loan Processing**: After the application, the loan processing status is available to the user. Loan approval happens based on criteria set by the bank.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, make sure you have:
either
- Docker (for containerization)
or
- Java 17 (for backend)
- Maven (for managing dependencies)
- PostgreSQL instance


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyaksheemahanta/spring-boot-docker.git
```

### 2. Docker Setup (Optional)

To run the application in Docker, follow the steps below:

- **Build Docker Image**:
